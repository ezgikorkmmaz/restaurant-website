<h1>Restaurant Menu</h1>

A prototype of a restaurant menu project. Firstly customer get information about the restaurant then see it's menu with detailed meals. There are filters for vegetarian and vegan options. Customers can pick their meals with multiple quality options and price ranges. It's really a basic practice for React, but it can be improved.

<h2>Used Packages</h2>
- &nbsp;react-router-dom for routing on project. All app has three views(screen) src/pages.<br>
- &nbsp;sass for styling the project.<br>
- &nbsp;Antd Radio, Dropdown, Menu components. <br>

<h2>To start this project on your computer. </h2>
- &nbsp;Open Visual Studio.<br>
- &nbsp;On the start window, select Clone a repository.<br>
- &nbsp;Enter or type the repository location(clone HTTPS from this repo), and then select the Clone button.<br>
- &nbsp;It will open a new window, then on your terminal, type 'npm install' to install all modules.<br>
- &nbsp;After you're ready type 'npm start' and you can see your project.


<p>Note: </p>
I added a comment line and a console in MealsInfo page. I used antd Radio button and there is an issue with package or it could be something I wasn't able to fix. Ingredients selected quality values looks like they change in each selection but I store them in an array and make calculations according to it. If you can check from console you can see.

If you have any question or suggestion, feel free to ask.

Hope to hear from you soon!
